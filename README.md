# Data-Driven-COVID-19-Vaccination-Insights-Visualization-and-Analysis-Application

This project provides an interactive tool built with Python (Tkinter, Plotly, and Pandas) for analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 vaccination data. Users can load datasets related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, 
and vaccine distributions, and generate various types of charts and maps to explore the data.

Key Features:

Load and process multiple datasets (transformed data, raw data, and vaccine data)

Predict death rates based on different vaccine types

Visualize global COVID-19 vaccination distribution with bubble maps and choropleths

Display bar charts for the countries with the highest cases and deaths

Grouped bar charts comparing total cases and deaths

Pie charts representing the percentage of cases and deaths

Visualize the Stringency Index during the pandemic


Technologies Used:

Tkinter (GUI)

Plotly (charts and maps)

Pandas (data processing)

PIL (for image handling)

Simply load your data and explore the visualizations for insightful analysis of COVID-19 vaccines and their impact globally.
